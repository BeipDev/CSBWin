Linux:
	You will need to have Gnome and SDL properly
	installed on your system. If your SDL has been
	compiled with Hermes statically linked, you
	will need Hermes installed as well. You need
	esd for sound.

	To compile CSB for linux, type
	
		chmod +x autogen.sh
		./autogen.sh --enable-release
		make

	You also need the following files in your directory
	in order to play the game:
	
	dungeon.dat hcsb.dat hcsb.hct mini.dat
	graphics.dat config.txt
	
	Those files are not distributed with the source code. You can download
	them separately from http://dmweb.free.fr.
	
	If you encounters some problem, feel free to contact me
		Erik Svanberg <svanberg@acc.umu.se>

	If autogen.sh complains about a bad interpreter or that some files
	is missing, then it could be that those files have there end-of-line
	in DOS-style ('\n\r'), rather than in Posix style ('\n').
	If necessery check these files:
	
	autogen.sh configure.in Makefile.am macros/autogen.sh src/Makefile.am
